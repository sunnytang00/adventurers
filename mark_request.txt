# Explorer Mark Request

(You should put an [X] in boxes with completed features.
Lines starting with ">" are additional comments.)

[X] There is a player is displayed on the screen.

[X] The player can be moved by pressing keys
> You can use the Up/Down/Left/Right keys to move around. (CHANGE THIS LINE IF IT IS NOT CORRECT)

[X] When the player tries to move off the screen, the screen follows them.

[X] The viewport does not necessarily always move when the player does.

[X] There are at least 5 block types (i.e different coloured blocks).

[X] The layout of the map is specified by a file on the filesystem.

[X] There is a 'barrier' block. When the player attempts to pass through it, they cannot.

[X] There is a 'water' block. When the player walks through the 10th block in a row, they die and the game ends.

[X] There is a 'sign' block. When the player walks over the sign block, a specified message is shown.

[X] There are 'objects' in my game -- when a player walks over the object, it disappears.

[X] There is a quests system in my game.
[X] The quests system is in a seperate module or crate to the game.

[X] The first quest (walking over sand blocks) is implemented.
[X] The 'q' key shows the progress of my user in this quest.
[X] The 'r' key resets progress of my user in this quest.

[X] The second quest (collecting five objects of one type, then three of another)
[X] The 'q' key shows the progress of my user in this quest.
[X] The 'r' key resets progress of my user in this quest.

[ ] The third quest (at least two of the three subquests) is implemented.
[ ] The 'q' key shows the progress of my user in this quest.
[ ] The 'r' key resets progress of my user in this quest.

[X] My quests system is designed to make it easy for a developer to add more quests.
^^^^ It's not that easy but its not that difficult either

## How to Run My Program

Assuming we have taken your crate, without any compilation; what commands will start the game?
Make sure you are inside adventurers/adventurers crate
> $ cargo run path/to/map.ron first_quest
e.g, cargo run ../full_game.ron q1

## Design Excellence

During the assignment we make suggestions for "design excellence". Please list all those
things you did, and where we can find them in your program.

- Player movement and coordinates are represented through structs, with appropriate traits to implement movement in player.rs
- Block types are represented through a enum in block.rs
- Map files are parsed using serde (lines 54, 55 in main.rs)
- Water (I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for but I felt like I did OK)

If you made any other design choices you think demonstrate an equivalent level
of design excellence, please list them below (including where to find them).
Note, we suggest you check with a tutor that your design is in fact excellent
before adding something below:

## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.

- I don't have proper error handling
- Quest system could probably done in a better way
